# Stock Analysis

## Overview

This repository is an analysis of a handful of green energy stocks. It contains an Excel spreadsheet with data on said stocks, and macros built to analyze and format the data. Some clients looking to invest in green energy decided they wanted to put all their funds into DAQO New Energy Corporation (Stock ticker "DQ"). The following analysis tries to determine whether that is a sound idea and also assesses the run time of the VBA scripts used to analyze the data and the pros and cons of refactoring those scripts from previous scripts (also contained in the macro-enabled workbook).
